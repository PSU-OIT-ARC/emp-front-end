                        <li>In PSU residence halls, fire drill tests are conducted once per term. Contact your residence hall

                        <li>In all other PSU buildings, fire alarm testing is most often done outside of normal business hours.
                            Tests planned during normal business hours are often announced to the building occupants.</li>
