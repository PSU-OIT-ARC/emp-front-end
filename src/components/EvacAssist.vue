        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          It may be necessary to evacuate a building, room, or space due to an emergency incident or hazardous, situation.
          Preparing for an evacuation is a shared responsibility among individuals, the University, and first responders.<br><br>
          All people, including individuals with disabilities and others with access and functional needs, are strongly encouraged to develop a personal emergency plan.
          PSUâ€™s Environmental Health and Safety department offers a
          <a href="https://www.pdx.edu/environmental-health-safety/emergency-planning-for-people-needing-assistance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">resource page</a>

            <h3>About this registry</h3>
            <p>
              PSU has developed this registry as a mechanism for individuals with a disability
              (or an access or functional need) that would prevent them from independently exiting a building during
              an emergency evacuation. If you register, your information will become accessible to first responders
              (information could include, as applicable: name, assigned residence hall room (PSU residents only),
              location of registered courses (student or instructor/faculty), assigned office location (staff),
              and/or contact information) The registry is confidential and is managed by CPSO. Data is refreshed weekly.
            <ul>
                Please note:
                <ul>
                    <li>This registry IS NOT a way to get advance notice of fire alarm tests or drills.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In PSU residence halls, fire drill tests are conducted once per term. Contact your residence hall
                            advisor if you need advance notice of those tests.</li>
                        <li>In all other PSU buildings, fire alarm testing is most often done outside of normal business hours.
                            Tests planned during normal business hours are often announced to the building occupants.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>This registry IS NOT a guarantee of immediate assistance.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Emergency personnel will assess the specific incident that occurs and apply the appropriate
                            protocol for stabilizing the incident and providing assistance. This registry is one piece of
                            information they can consider in their overall assessment of the incident.</li>
                        <li>When instructed to evacuate, every individual, as they are able, should make as much progress
                            toward evacuation as possible. This may mean moving away from the hazard, informing others of
                            your need for assistance, initiating communication with first responders, etc.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>

                <ul class="b">
                    <li>This registry is only ONE of SEVERAL WAYS to let first responders know of your need for evacuation assistance.</li>
                    <ul class="a">
                        <li>Other options include: making advance plans with your colleagues and co-workers, informing an

                            or a residence hall advisor in advance and/or in the moment, calling CPSO or 911, placing a sign in the window, etc.</li>
